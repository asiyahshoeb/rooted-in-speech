            Nafiah Khan is a speech-language pathologist, who previously worked in the public schools. After numerous inquiries from parents in the community about private therapy and general advice for their child, Nafiah Khan decided to start a small company to help bridge support required by parents in the local area. In the public schools, Nafiah worked with children requiring specialized support for autism and learning disabilities, as well as providing speech-language intervention for the general education students with articulation, stuttering, apraxia, and language intervention.
            Nafiah graduated from Eastern Michigan University (EMU) in 2020 with her master’s degree in Communication Sciences and Disorders. During her time as an undergraduate and master’s student at EMU, Nafiah conducted research on interprofessional collaboration through the Delores S. Brehm Endowed Scholarship in Special Education and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Students Preparing for Academic Research Careers (SPARC) Award. 
            Nafiah is also a registered respiratory therapist and is involved with the homeschool community in Canton. She is teaching writing through the Institute for the Excellence of Writing (IEW) curriculum at Medina Homeschool.
            Her therapy style includes play-based therapy, with an emphasis on connection over compliance. By building strong relationships with clients, the child is self-motivated to improve in speech therapy.
